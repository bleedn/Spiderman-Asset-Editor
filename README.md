# Spiderman-Model-Material-Parser
Drag and drop .models onto the exe to parse slot info, pair with my dummy materials blender plugin (https://bleedn.gumroad.com/l/dummymaterials) to correctly slot your materials based on what you need! (If your desired material is in slot '4' in the program, you would add 4 dummy materials to your model, as technically those would occupy slots 0, 1, 2, and 3)
If you don't like my code, I don't like it either, please don't complain about needless changes, thanks!
